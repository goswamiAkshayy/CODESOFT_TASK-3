# ATM INTERFACE PROGRAMM

**Task-3: ATM Interface**
<br/>
**Language: Java**
<br/>
**IDE: vsCode**
<br/>

**This basic ATM project allows a user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. You can further enhance it by adding features like transaction history or user authentication**
<br/>

**Let's break down the steps for your ATM project and implement each part.**

  <br/>
  
  1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
  
 <br/>
 
  2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
 checking the balance. 
 <br/>
 
 3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
 checkBalance(). 
 
 <br/>
 
 4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
 
 <br/>
 
 5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
 balance.
 
 <br/>
 
 6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
 
 <br/>
 
 7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
 of their transactions
